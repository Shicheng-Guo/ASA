* 445 [UK-biobank-RA-SNPs](https://github.com/Shicheng-Guo/HowtoBook/blob/master/rheumatology/RA/UKbiobank/M05.csv): TNXB, MICB, PAX5, NRXN11
* Genetic Association Study (GAS) [Power Calculator](http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/cats/gas_power_calculator/index.html) is a simple interface that can be used to compute statistical power for large one-stage genetic association studies. The underlying method is derived from the [CaTS power calculator](http://csg.sph.umich.edu//abecasis/CaTS/download.html) for two-stage association studies (2006)
