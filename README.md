* This Genetic Association Study (GAS) [Power Calculator](http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/cats/gas_power_calculator/index.html) is a simple interface that can be used to compute statistical power for large one-stage genetic association studies. The underlying method is derived from the CaTS power calculator for two-stage association studies (2006)
