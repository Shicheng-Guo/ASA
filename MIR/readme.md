* ROI-miRNA-SNPs: [miRNAcommonSNP.txt](https://github.com/Shicheng-Guo/AnnotationDatabase/blob/master/hg19/miRNA/miRNA-SNP/miRNAcommonSNP.txt)
* 0 miRNA-SNPs were identified in R0.6 imputate dataset ([minimac4-1.0.1-7228771 && eagle-2.4](./imputation.log.txt)): [script](merge.R)
* Then, I am thinking how about to set R2=0.3?
