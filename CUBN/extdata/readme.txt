Title: Novel Genetic susceptibility loci in CUBN associated with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis

ROI.hwe: Hardy-Weinberg test statistics for each SNP for CUBN. SNPs in control group should not signficant which means P should higher than 0.05 or 0.01. this table will be put to supplementary table
ROI.assoc.logistic: logistic based case-control test for CUBN. default style is to test additive model --ADD-- in logistic regression. this file will be one of most important table in the manuscript
ROI.assoc.logistic.adjusted: this file include all the multiple-test corrected P-value for each SNPs in CUBN.  When you prepare the manuscript, this file should be integrate with above file --ROI.assoc.logistic--
ROI.assoc: Chi-square based case-control test for CUBN. this file will be one of most important table in the manuscript since it showed the number of alleles in case and control
ROI.assoc.adjusted: this file include all the multiple-test corrected P-value --in the file: ROI.assoc-- for each SNPs in CUBN.  When you prepare the manuscript, this file should be integrate with above file --ROI.assoc--
ROI.assoc.fisher: Fisher exact test based case-control association between SNPs and RA. This file will be useful when any cell lt 5. Usually when certain cell have number lt 5, we report fisher P-value not Chi-square P-value
ROI.assoc.fisher.adjusted: this file include all the multiple-test corrected P-value --in the file: ROI.assoc-- for each SNPs in CUBN.  When you prepare the manuscript, this file should be integrate with above file --ROI.assoc--
ROI.model: Fisher's exact test based case-control association with different models for CUBN. this file is one of most important table in the manuscript
ROI.dominant.assoc.logistic: logistic regression based association in dominant models for CUBN. this file is one of most important table in the manuscript. In the file of ROI.model, the DOM is based on fisher's exact test
ROI.recessive.assoc.logistic: logistic regression based association in recessive models for CUBN. this file is one of most important table in the manuscript
haplotype.assoc.hap: chi-square test based haplotype association. This file is important which can be shown with significant haplotype as a table in the manuscript

Abstract: The heritability of RA has been shown from twin studies to be 60%. Since 2007, rapid advances in technology underpinning the use of genome-wide association studies have allowed the identification of hundreds of genetic risk factors for many complex diseases. There are now >100 genetic loci that have been associated with RA. In the previous study, the contribution of HLA to heritability has been estimated to be 11â€“37% while 100 non-HLA loci were shown to explain 4.7% of the heritability of RA in Asians. The majority of the heritability is still missing. CUBN  have xxxxxx function which might be invovled in  pathology of RA. therefore, In this study, we conducted assocation study to investigate the role of xx and its paralog genes and in RA. in the first stage, we colllected 1078 seropositive RA and 1045 matched control. xxx SNPs in xx, xxx, xxx, xx were genotyped. We found SNPs rsxxx in xxx was signifciantly associated with RA, P=xxx, 95%CI.
