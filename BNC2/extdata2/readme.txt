Title: Novel Genetic susceptibility loci in BNC2 associated with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis

ROI.hwe: Hardy-Weinberg test statistics for each SNP for BNC2. SNPs in control group should not signficant which means P should higher than 0.05 or 0.01. this table will be put to supplementary table
ROI.assoc.logistic: logistic based case-control test for BNC2. default style is to test additive model --ADD-- in logistic regression. this file will be one of most important table in the manuscript
ROI.assoc.logistic.adjusted: this file include all the multiple-test corrected P-value for each SNPs in BNC2.  When you prepare the manuscript, this file should be integrate with above file --ROI.assoc.logistic--
ROI.assoc: Chi-square based case-control test for BNC2. this file will be one of most important table in the manuscript since it showed the number of alleles in case and control
ROI.assoc.adjusted: this file include all the multiple-test corrected P-value --in the file: ROI.assoc-- for each SNPs in BNC2.  When you prepare the manuscript, this file should be integrate with above file --ROI.assoc--
ROI.assoc.fisher: Fisher exact test based case-control association between SNPs and RA. This file will be useful when any cell lt 5. Usually when certain cell have number lt 5, we report fisher P-value not Chi-square P-value
ROI.assoc.fisher.adjusted: this file include all the multiple-test corrected P-value --in the file: ROI.assoc-- for each SNPs in BNC2.  When you prepare the manuscript, this file should be integrate with above file --ROI.assoc--
ROI.model: Fisher's exact test based case-control association with different models for BNC2. this file is one of most important table in the manuscript
ROI.dominant.assoc.logistic: logistic regression based association in dominant models for BNC2. this file is one of most important table in the manuscript. In the file of ROI.model, the DOM is based on fisher's exact test
ROI.recessive.assoc.logistic: logistic regression based association in recessive models for BNC2. this file is one of most important table in the manuscript
